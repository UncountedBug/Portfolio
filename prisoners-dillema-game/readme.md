So Basically we developed this mini game using the concept of prisoners of dilemma in which there are two prisoners.they have given two options one is cooperate and other is betray.either they both chose coopearte or both chose betray or one chose cooperate and other betray or simultaneously

**Situations:**
1. if one prisoner choses betray and other choses cooperate then the prissoner who choses betray rewarded with some points and other didnot get the point.
2. if both choses cooperate they both rewarded with equal points.
3. if both choses betray they didnot get any points

**We uses three basic web development language to develope this small game**

**HTML**
we use html for basic designing of body

**CSS**
css is used to styling the contents, button fonts and etc.

**JAVASCRIPT**
this is the language we used for writing the logic of game. this mainly describes what is happening after clicking the buttons.
